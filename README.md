I am Rafael, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
I graduated in Economics and worked as a Strategy Analyst for many years.
Later on, I moved to Europe, where I worked mostly as a Client Service Analyst, in 4 different companies.
In the past years I decided to a new working field, that would match my experiences.  So I am studying to master Data Analysis skills and tools, such as:
 - Excel, Power BI and Dashboards
 - MySQL and Databases
 - Python and Data Science Libraries (Pandas, Numpy, etc)
 
 My current objective with my Github profile is to share a few things I have been working on; in order to network and help me get my 1st position as a Data Analyst.
