I am Rafael, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
I graduated in Economics and worked as a Strategy Analyst for many years.
Later on I moved to Europe, where I worked mostly as a Client Service Analyst, in 4 different companies.
In the past years I decided to try something new that woudl match my experiences, so I am studying to master Data Analysis skills and tools, such as:
 - Excel, Power BI and Dashboards
 - MySQL and Databses
 - Python and Data Science Libraries (Pandas, NUmpy, etc)
 
 My current objective with my Github profile is to share a few things I have worked on in order to network and help me get my 1st position as a Data Analyst.
